                <p> Braids are a beautiful piece of African culture symbolizing freedom, beauty, self-confidence, love, heritage and many more meanings. 
                    Women/girls are able to express their creativeness and culture through braids. Braids connect the African community through the embodiment of the natural beauty of black Africa.
                    As black women/girls it is important to learn and embrace the culture that braids were built upon. 
                    Bvudzi braids wants black women/girls to express themselves through their hairstyles in their own unique way.  </p>

                <h2>Benfits</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Our plant-based braiding hair is formulated to match textured hair with few ingredients and is manufactured from naturally derived banana fibre. 
                    Bvudzi Braids are made of biodegradable materials and have less of an impact on the environment than braids made from traditional synthetic extensions. 
                    They are less likely to add to the plastic waste that ends up in our landfills and our oceans. Bvudzi braids can be disposed of in an environmentally friendly way by composting or by putting them in a compostable waste receptacle.
                     Over time, they will degrade and sustainably re-enter the environment. </p>

                <h2>Striving for better</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Bvudzi braids not only symbolise the future of hair extensions, but also a healthy, eco-friendly way of life that is constantly changing because there is always potential for improvement. 
                    It's about embracing beauty that coexists with nature and making sure that our individual decisions support the international campaign to fight plastic pollution and lessen our carbon footprint. 
                    Making improvements in the field of environmentally friendly braiding is a small but important step towards a better, more sustainable future. We'll keep coming up with new ideas for our business and products that benefit the world. </p>
